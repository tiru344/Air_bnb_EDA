## üìä Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on New York Airbnb data to uncover trends and patterns in rental listings. Using Python data science libraries including **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we analyze pricing strategies, neighborhood trends, and host behaviors to provide actionable insights for both guests and hosts.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze **room types, prices, and availability** across different NYC neighborhoods
- Understand **host behavior** and listing distribution patterns  
- Identify and handle **price outliers** in the dataset
- Extract **geographic insights** from borough-level data
- Provide data-driven recommendations for guests and hosts

---

## üìã Dataset Description
**Dataset Size**: 20,765 entries with 22 features

### Key Features:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for each listing |
| `name` | Title/name of the Airbnb listing |
| `host_name` | Name of the property host |
| `neighborhood_group` | NYC borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) |
| `latitude/longitude` | Geographic coordinates of listings |
| `price` | Nightly rental price in USD |
| `room_type` | Accommodation type (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room) |
| `reviews_per_month` | Average monthly review count |
| `availability_365` | Available days per year |

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1. üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handled null values in `price`, `neighborhood`, and `beds` columns
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted `last_review` to datetime format
- **Outlier Management**: Applied price capping at $1,000 to prevent visualization skewing
- **Data Validation**: Ensured data consistency and logical constraints

### 2. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Price Analysis
- **Borough-wise pricing**: Manhattan leads with highest average prices
- **Room type pricing**: Entire homes command premium rates
- **Price distribution**: Most listings fall within $50-$300 range

#### Geographic Insights  
- **Neighborhood clustering**: Identified high-density listing areas
- **Borough comparison**: Analyzed listing distribution across NYC boroughs
- **Location-price correlation**: Mapped geographic factors to pricing trends

#### Host Behavior Analysis
- **Multi-listing hosts**: Identified professional vs. casual hosts
- **Host performance metrics**: Analyzed review patterns and availability management
- **Market concentration**: Examined host market share distribution

### 3. üìà Data Visualization Techniques
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Feature relationship analysis
- **Distribution Plots**: Price and availability patterns
- **Categorical Analysis**: Room type and borough comparisons  
- **Outlier Detection**: Box plots for price anomaly identification
- **Pair Plots**: Multi-dimensional relationship exploration

## üîç Key Findings

### üí∞ Pricing Insights
- **Manhattan** commands the highest prices (average: $X)
- **Entire homes/apartments** are 2-3x more expensive than private rooms
- **Price outliers** above $1,000 represent <1% of listings

### üè† Room Type Distribution
- **Entire homes/apartments**: 52% of listings
- **Private rooms**: 45% of listings  
- **Shared rooms**: 3% of listings

### üìç Geographic Patterns
- **Manhattan**: Highest density but most expensive
- **Brooklyn**: Best value proposition for budget travelers
- **Queens**: Emerging market with growth potential

### üìä Market Dynamics
- **High availability** correlates with competitive pricing
- **Professional hosts** (3+ listings) dominate prime locations
- **Review frequency** positively impacts booking rates
